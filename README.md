# ai-conversation-generator

WIP: Scripts I use to make open source GPT models have conversations with one another in the attempt to make datasets.

Currently I am testing having a quantized alpaca-lora finetuned llama 30B dataset have self conversations, then using the resulting dataset to fine-tune a non-quantized llama 7b model and a llama 7b model that was already fine tuned with alpaca-lora dataset.
